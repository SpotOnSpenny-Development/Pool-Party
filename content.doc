ABOUT US
It's no secret: the modern day lottery is broken. In fact, you have a better chance of becoming the
next president of the united states, than winning the next powerball. At the Solana Pool Party Lottery
we believe that decentralized lotteries have the opportunity to change that. That's why this summer and
beyond, we're hosting lotteries with a 1/5000 chance to win the grand prize of ~4000 SOL. That means
you're 2,816,901x more likely to win here than a traditional lottery, and that's just the grand prize.
On top of that, your ticket can be exchanged for raffle tickets for genuine solana blue chip
NFTs. Welcome to the pool party, jump on in the water's great.

ROADMAP
Phase 1 - The Pool is Open
With our social ecosystem set up, the discord will open, tweets will flow, and the general marketing kickoff will commense.
During this stage of our project, the goal is to bring people into the community by participating in
twitter spaces, building a website, having community giveaways and running consistent events.

Phase 2 - Dipping Our Toes In
Now that the pool is open and the community is here, we will launch our NFTs, which will each give you
a single entry to the grand prize of the Pool Party Lottery. The prize pool for the lottery will go to the prize pool,
the slush fund, as well as to paying the team.

Phase 3 - Cannonball
Once the NFTs have been purchased, and the funds divided into the appropriate pools, a winning NFT will
be selected and the holder of that NFT will be sent the grand prize! This will be conducted by random draw via
livestream to start, but will evolve with the project.

Phase 4 - The Diving Board
After the grand prize has been handed out, holders will be able to exchange their entry NFT for our 
utility token, $TOWL. This token will be used to purchase additional raffle tickets for genuine blue chip
NFT projects purchased with the Slush Fund. This means that the purchase of an entry NFT gives you not 
only an entry for the grand prize, but also additional entries into other draws for NFTs, Solana, and more.

Phase 5 - No Running
Though most pools say that running on the pool deck is unsafe, luckily for us, pool rules don't include running it back.
After our first lottery and raffles, we'll be  resetting our whitelist and starting again from Phase 
2 to launch consistent lotteries, grow our community even further and give you more chances at that 
sweet sweet prize money

Phase 6 - The Deep exchanged
We're not stopping at lotteries! As we continue to develop our lottery protocol, we plan to open it
up to public use for a small fee, which will be distributed along with mint funds, by standardizing crypto lotteries on Solana utilizing the transparency,
security and automation that come with being built on chain.

FUND DISTRIBUTION
The mint funds of each lottery will be distributed as follows:
% to core team
% to prize pool
% to Slush Fund

What is the slush fund?
Aside from our core team of co-founders, we'll need to take good care of our artists and other talent
that we've on boarded to bring you the best lottery project in Solana. This is what the Slush Fund was
created for. It will also be used as a reserve to stabalize the lottery prize pool, and also will be
used to purchase raffle projects. This distrbution will be as follows:
% to team payment
% to reserve
% to raffle prizes
